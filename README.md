These incidents under Title IX include discrimination based on sex, gender, sexual orientation, nationality, immigration status, race or disabilities, sexual assualt and sexual harassment. Some problems include worries about coming forward, feelings of guilt or shame, fear of retaliation or repurcussions, exposure and lack of anonymity, issues with the investigations, nothing getting finished, cases being dismissed/lost, after effects and the need for additional resources or counseling and so on.
# Who is being empowered by your mapplication?
Students at UCLA who are having issues with filing incident reports to the UCLA Title IX Office.
# What technical and ethical problems could there be in developing this tool?
**Technical** | **Ethical**
----------|----------
Not enough people willing to participate | Keeping participation and information anonymous and private
Visualizing data | Keeping the goal away from encouraging people to come forward
Variety, randomness, and representation | The goal should be empowering voices not persuading them
Wording questions properly/not place blame/make feel guilty | Not invalidating or prioritizing (creating a hierarchy) people's experiences
#Technology used for this project:

# How could this project be used in the future?
* Help certain offices/departments at UCLA understand how to help students.
* Be a place where someone can hear other people's stories, in an effort to feel less alone.
* Provide students who are struggling with resources that other students feel are useful.
