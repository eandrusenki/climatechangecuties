# General Information
## About
Title IX is an education amendment that prohibits the discrimination of any person based on sex, gender, sexual orientation, nationality, immigration status, race or disabilities, by an educational institution that is federally funded. Under Title IX sexual assualt and acts of sexual violence are also prohibited. Many campuses have Title IX offices that deal with these issues and they happen in all types of circumstances on campuses like UCLA including:
* In the classroom
* Housing Offices
* Financial Aid
* Athletics
* College Admissions
* Mental Health Offices/Services

Many students struggle to come forward due to fear of the stigmatization around these issues, fear of retaliation, embarrassment, or the hardships and difficulty with reporting to the office. The Trump Administration and Former Secretary of Education Betsy Devosâ€™ changes to and limitations of Title IX on college campuses have made reporting and coming forward more difficult than it already was. On anonymous forums all over the internet such as the UCLA reddit page and the facebook UCLA Secrets page, you can find criticisms regarding the UCLA Title IX campus office and the way they are administered. 

## Who is being empowered?
We are hoping that anyone affiliated with UCLA (students, alumni, employees) who has reported to the UCLA Title IX Office or *felt* like they needed to, can use this project to empower themselves in multiple ways. One way being the ability to share their story and speak up, another being giving resources and hopefully making them feel like they are/can help others who have gone through similar experiences. And another is for them to provide words of encouragement for other survivors, which in tunr, can allow them to empower others as well. The most important aspect of this empowerment is that everything is anonymous.
