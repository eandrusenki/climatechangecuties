# Pre-Web Development
## What technical and ethical problems could there be in developing this tool?
**Technical** | **Ethical**
----------|----------
Not enough people willing to participate | Keeping participation and information anonymous and private
Visualizing data | Keeping the goal away from encouraging people to come forward
Variety, randomness, and representation | The goal should be empowering voices not persuading them
Wording questions properly/not place blame/make feel guilty | Not invalidating or prioritizing (creating a hierarchy) people's experiences
