     <p> We are hoping that anyone affiliated with UCLA (students, alumni, employees) can use this project and data collected to be given to groups such as the UCLA Office of Equity, Diversity and Inclusion, UCLA Care, Bruin Consent Coalition, Civil Rights organizations on campus, cultural sororities and fraternities, the CAPS Center at UCLA, and other offices to be used in sensitivity training, to better understand how students feel and are being treated while on campus. Most importantly this project is to allow students to anonymously share their stories, help students who are facing such issues and to feel less alone, show them resources and places they can go if they donâ€™t feel safe going to the UCLA Title IX Office, give them support, make them feel heard and empower them long term.
